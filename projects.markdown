### Bad Ass Baking Company Branding & Style Guide ###

<!-- Image Placeholder -->

A fictional company, The Badass Baking Company is a bakery located on the west end of Toronto. With the previous owner now retired, the inheritors of the business wanted to rebrand into something that would stand out among the other similar businesses in the area.

Inspired by the tatto shops across the city, they decided to re-brand into the Badass Baking Company, evoking the style and edgines of tattoo parlours with a touch of contemporary design elements.

Below are some of the images from the branding & style guide I created for this project, illustrating the colours, fonts, and layout rules for the company's branding.
